Well, that particular command does not help me because I need to use the diff or the difftool command, 
so that I can see those differences just for the specified file i.e. I can type git diff conf/application.conf 
but typing git status -vv conf/application.conf, will still show me all the changes in the console. 
Because in practice I never have just one file modified, there are perhaps tens of files, with tens of modified lines of code, 
and scrolling for half a minute to find what I need is not efficient. But technically, your answer is correct, indee

this is great 

and
